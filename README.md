# javascript-challenge


There were a few really challenging parts to this. Learning how to animate the text and getting the code right in the filter part. 
If I had more time I would have liked to scraped more recent UFO info and then shared this site becuase it looks good. 
I got ideas for how to do my own personal site from this as well as the filtering of data inside JS. I hope you enjoy.
